        <strong>D20 System</strong>

    </h1>

    <!--Intro Info-->

    <p>

        The <strong>d20 System</strong> is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-playing_game_system">role-playing game system</a> published in 2000 by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-playing_game_system">Wizards of the Coast</a>, originally developed for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-playing_game_system">3rd edition</a> of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-playing_game_system">Dungeons & Dragons</a>. The system is named after the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-playing_game_system">20-sided dice</a> 
        which are central to the core mechanics of many actions in the game.

    </p>

    <p>

        Much of the d20 System was released as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_Reference_Document">System Reference Document</a> (SRD) under the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Game_License">Open Game License</a> (OGL) as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_gaming">Open Game Content</a> (OGC), which allows commercial and non-commercial publishers to release modifications or supplements to the system without paying for the use of the system's associated intellectual property, which is owned by Wizards of the Coast.

    </p>

    <p>

    The original impetus for the open licensing of the d20 System involved the economics of producing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-playing_game_system">role-playing games system</a> (RPGs). Game supplements suffered far more diminished sales over time than the core books required to play the game. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Dancey">Ryan Dancey</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brand_management">brand manager</a> for Dungeons & Dragons at the time, directed the effort of licensing the new edition of Dungeons & Dragons through the d20 System Trademark, allowing other companies to support the d20 System under a common brand identity. This is distinct from the Open Game License, which simply allows any party to produce works composed of or derivative of designated Open Game Content.
